GitHub Pages now uses customizable GitHub Action workflows to build and deploy your code so that developers can control their authoring framework and deployment. GitHub Pages is a powerful option for storing static content for the following reasons:

It’s free.
It makes collaboration easy. Anyone can open a pull request to update the site.
Your repository syncs with any changes you made to your site.
While GitHub Pages comes with a default domain name like, https://YOUR_USER_NAME.github.io/ , it supports custom domains.
It uses customizable GitHub Action workflows for builds and deployments.
Let’s learn how to host static sites built with HTML on GitHub Pages!

After you create and store HTML in a repository, navigate to the settings tab for that repository.

Clicking configure will lead you to a pre-made workflow. Feel free to review the YAML, tweak it to your preference, and commit the code.
